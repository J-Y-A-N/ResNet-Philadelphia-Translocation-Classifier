# ResNet-Philadelphia-Translocation-Classifier

This is a web program that incorporates p5 machine learning library and Google's Teachable Machine platform and is capable of classiifying images of chromosome 9 and 22 images into regular and with translocation. The idea is from my previous high school research project(https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=97443). I wanted to create a product that anyone can use instead of just a deep learning model. 

* The model this web program uses is differnet from the one I implemented during high school. Google's Teachable Machine platform only uses MobileNet for image classification tasks (I believe?).
